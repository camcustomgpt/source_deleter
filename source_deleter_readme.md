Delete Any Source Containing a Given String
Start the program through the command line by navigating to the file location.
Once you are in the directory, type 'python source_deleter.py'
You will be prompted to enter your CustomGPT API Key. Paste that into the command line to proceed.
Next, you will be prompted to enter the CustomGPT Project ID for the project you wish to delete files for. Enter that to proceed.
Finally, you will need to enter the string you wish to search for and delete. Entering .pdf will delete pdf files, and so on.
Note: This also works for pages included in a sitemap, so if you wish to delete youtube.com links from a sitemap, for example, you could enter:
youtube.com, and those will be removed from the project.
